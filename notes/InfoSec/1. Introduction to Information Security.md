#### What is Information Security?

Information security is the practice of protecting information by mitigating information risks. It involves protecting data from unauthorized access, modification, and disruption while ensuring availability to authorized users.

#### Forms of Security

Security exists in three intertwined forms in current practice:

1. **Physical Security**: Protection of infrastructure, installations, and physical objects. Only authorized people get access to secured assets.
    
2. **Personnel Security**: Protection of people. Focuses on minimizing damage to or from people within an organization.
    
3. **Information Security**: Protection of data - this is the focus of this course.
    

#### Different Perspectives on Security

**1. The Art of Adversarial Thinking**

Bruce Schneier's perspective: "Security requires a particular mindset. Security professionals -- at least the good ones -- see the world differently. They can't walk into a store without noticing how they might shoplift. They can't use a computer without wondering about the security vulnerabilities. They can't vote without trying to figure out how to vote twice. They just can't help it."

This introduces the concept of "Harvest now - decrypt later" - adversaries collecting encrypted data now with the hope of decrypting it in the future when more powerful computing becomes available.

**2. Defense in Depth - Lessons from The Stronghold of Bourtange**

Historical fortifications provide excellent examples of security principles:

- **Defense in depth**: Multiple layers of protection
- **Variation of defenses**: Different types of defensive mechanisms
- **Limited number of ports of entry**: Controlled access points
- **Sentries at critical points**: Vigilant monitoring at key locations

#### Why is Security Hard?

Despite its importance, there are frequent large-scale security violations due to:

1. **Perception of security**: Often viewed as overhead rather than enabling trusted operation
2. **Security is difficult**: Finding all vulnerabilities is extremely challenging
3. **Intelligent adversaries**: Adversaries are consistently working to counteract security efforts

**Key challenges:**

- Security implies thinking through all vulnerabilities that could be exploited and ensuring defenses
- Security faces opposition from intelligent adversaries actively working to counteract efforts
- Widespread perception that security just prevents attacks, rather than enabling trusted operation

#### Specific Prevention Measures

**Intrusion Detection/Prevention (IDS/IPS)**

- Monitors network traffic and analyzes patterns and anomalies
- Detects potential threats and triggers response mechanisms to prevent security breaches

**Network Segmentation**

- Divides the network into smaller, isolated segments
- Restricts lateral movement of attackers in the event of a breach
- Implements segmentation controls and access policies
- Contains threats and minimizes impact on critical systems

**Encryption and Cryptography**

- Protects sensitive data both in transit and at rest
- Uses cryptographic algorithms to ensure confidentiality and integrity
- Makes it challenging for unauthorized parties to intercept or tamper with information

**Secure Communication**

- Protocols such as SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security)
- Establishes encrypted connections between clients and servers
- Ensures confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged over the network

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

- Adds an extra layer of security
- Requires multiple forms of authentication: passwords, biometrics, or one-time codes
- Mitigates the risk of unauthorized access, especially with compromised credentials

### Objectives of Security

The four main objectives of security are:

1. **Confidentiality**: Information only available to authorized users
2. **Integrity**: Information retains intended content and semantics
3. **Availability**: Information retains access and presence
4. **Authenticity**: Information remains linked to its originator

**Note**: The importance of these objectives shifts depending on the organization.

#### Classes of Threat

Each security objective has a corresponding threat:

- **Interception** → threatens Confidentiality
- **Modification** → threatens Integrity
- **Masquerade** → threatens Authenticity
- **Interruption** → threatens Availability

**Important**: Most security problems are people-related.

### Risks of Information Insecurity

#### Confidentiality Risks - Unauthorized Access to:

- Personnel and student records and accounts
- Medical records
- Financial information
- Access information to computer and bank accounts
- E-mail
- Student progress data

**Case Study: 2023 MOVEit Data Breach**

- Exploited a zero-day vulnerability in MOVEit Transfer software
- Used by many organizations to securely transfer files
- Attackers from the Cl0p ransomware group exploited the vulnerability
- Resulted in access and exfiltration of large amounts of sensitive data
- Compromised data included personal records, financial information, and sensitive documents

#### Integrity Risks - Compromising Information:

- Legal records
- Tax information
- Financial data
- Generally: modifying information considered sensitive, confidential, or secret

**Case Study: SolarWinds Attack**

- State-sponsored attackers inserted malicious code into a software update
- Affected SolarWinds' Orion platform (widely used for network management)
- Organizations applying the software update unknowingly installed a backdoor
- Allowed attackers to access and potentially modify sensitive data within networks

#### Availability Risks - Service Disruption:

- Resource blocking/stealing
- Slowed down computer or network
- Third-party initiated/controlled illegal activities
- Downtime and costly repairs

### Legal Basis

#### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

The GDPR is a comprehensive data protection law enacted by the European Union that came into effect on May 25, 2018. It protects the privacy and personal data of individuals within the EU and EEA.

**Key Principles:**

- Subjects must have given their consent
- Data may only be used for intended purpose
- No additional data may be collected beyond what's necessary
- Integrity and confidentiality are required

The GDPR establishes rules on how personal data should be collected, processed, stored, and transferred, both within the EU and beyond.

#### EU-US Privacy Shield and Data Privacy Framework (DPF)

**Privacy Shield** (Now Defunct):

- This framework was designed to protect fundamental rights of anyone in the EU whose personal data is transferred to the United States for commercial purposes
- Allowed free transfer of data to companies certified in the US under the Privacy Shield
- Was deemed inadequate and discontinued

**EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF)** (Current):

- Main difference is emphasis on transparency
- Requires participating companies to publicly disclose privacy policies
- Must disclose third-party service providers used
- Introduces new binding safeguards ensuring access by U.S. intelligence is allowed only to the extent necessary and proportionate
- Includes mechanisms to handle/resolve complaints from Europeans for national security purposes

**Relevance**: This is important because many US companies operate in the EU.

#### NIS 2 Directive: Strengthening Cybersecurity Across Europe

The NIS 2 Directive is an updated EU regulation focused on enhancing cybersecurity across member states.

**1. Introduction to NIS 2**

- Builds on the original Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive
- Expands scope and introduces stricter requirements

**2. Key Objectives**

- **Improved Cyber Resilience**: Establishes stronger security requirements for critical sectors (energy, health, finance, digital infrastructure)
- **Expanded Coverage**: Extends to more sectors including public administration, space, and manufacturing
- **Harmonization Across EU**: Aims to standardize cybersecurity measures across all EU member states

**3. Major Requirements**

- **Risk Management & Reporting**: Companies must implement risk management practices and report significant incidents within 24 hours
- **Supply Chain Security**: Emphasizes the importance of securing supply chains, including third-party service providers
- **Enhanced Cooperation**: Encourages cooperation among EU states for coordinated responses to cross-border cybersecurity threats

**4. Impact on Organizations**

- **Compliance Obligations**: Organizations must comply with stringent security measures or face significant fines
- **Strategic Importance**: NIS 2 places cybersecurity as a key component of national security and economic stability

**5. Why It Matters**

- NIS 2 is directly related to how companies protect data, respond to cyber threats, and ensure the continuity of essential services
- Influences the strategies and operations of businesses in all sectors

## Cryptography Basics

### Basic Definitions

- **Cipher/Cryptosystem**: Used to encrypt plaintext
- **Ciphertext**: The result of encryption
- **Decryption**: Process to recover plaintext from ciphertext
- **Key**: Used to configure a cryptosystem
- **Symmetric Key Cryptosystem**: Uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt
- **Public Key/Asymmetric Key Cryptosystem**: Uses a public key to encrypt and a private key to decrypt

### Fundamental Principles

#### Kerckhoffs's Principle (1835-1903)

**Definition**: The security of a cryptographic system should depend entirely on the secrecy of the key, not the secrecy of the encryption algorithm itself.

**Implications:**

- This openness allows for rigorous scrutiny by the cryptographic community
- Ensures robustness against attacks
- Modern cryptography adheres to this principle

**Example**: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) - the algorithm is public, but security depends on the secrecy of the key.

**Source**: Journal des Sciences Militaires Jan/Feb 1883

#### Claude Shannon's Core Design Principles

**1. Confusion**

- The relationship between plaintext, key, and ciphertext should be as complex and non-obvious as possible
- **Goal**: Hide how the key influences the ciphertext
- **Typically achieved using**: Substitution operations

**2. Diffusion**

- Each bit of the plaintext should influence many bits of the ciphertext
- Small changes in plaintext → large, unpredictable changes in ciphertext
- **Typically achieved using**: Permutation and mixing operations

**Methods vs Principles:**

- **Substitution**: Change/replace letters (uses confusion)
    - Can substitute characters ('a' → 'p')
    - Can substitute words (e.g., the Zimmerman telegram, 1917)
- **Transposition**: Rearrange letters (uses diffusion)
    - Less strong/effective than substitution

#### Perfect Secrecy

**Definition**: A cryptosystem provides perfect secrecy if observing the ciphertext gives no additional information about the plaintext.

**Formally**: The attacker's probability of guessing the message does not change after seeing the ciphertext.

**Implications:**

- The ciphertext reveals nothing about the plaintext without the key
- The only possible attack is exhaustive key search
- No structural weaknesses or shortcuts exist

**Reality Check - Why Perfect Secrecy Is Rare in Practice:**

1. **Key length must equal message length**
    
    - The key must be at least as long as the plaintext
    - Every bit of the message needs a fresh, truly random key bit
    - For large or frequent communications, this becomes impractical at scale
2. **Keys must be truly random**
    
    - Pseudo-random generators are not sufficient
    - Generating, storing, and verifying truly random keys is expensive and error-prone
3. **Keys must never be reused**
    
    - Reusing a key even once completely breaks perfect secrecy
    - In real systems, key reuse happens accidentally (protocol errors, backups, misconfiguration)
4. **Secure key distribution is required**
    
    - Sender and receiver must already share the secret key securely
    - This raises the classic "key distribution problem": If you already have a secure channel to share the key, why not use it to send the message?
5. **No forward scalability**
    
    - Perfect secrecy does not scale well to large networks, many users, or long-lived sessions
    - Modern systems require frequent communication with minimal pre-shared secrets

**Conclusion**: Perfect secrecy is theoretically achievable (e.g., One-Time Pad), but impractical for most real-world systems due to key management requirements.

### Classic Ciphers

#### Shift Ciphers (Caesar Cipher)

**Definition**: A mono-alphabetic substitution cipher where each plaintext letter is replaced by another letter at a fixed offset in the alphabet.

**What is mono-alphabetic substitution?**

- Each plaintext letter is always replaced by the same ciphertext letter
- Uses a single fixed substitution alphabet
- Key properties:
    - One-to-one mapping
    - Mapping does not change during encryption
    - Same plaintext letter → same ciphertext letter every time

**Generalization:**

- x = numerical value of plaintext letter (A = 0, …, Z = 25)
- c = numerical value of ciphertext letter
- n = shift key

**Formula:**

- Encryption: c = (x + n) mod 26
- Decryption: x = (c - n) mod 26

**Caesar Cipher Example:**

- Plaintext: informationsecuritycourse
- Key: 4-shift (a→E, b→F, c→G, etc.)

|a|b|c|d|e|f|g|h|i|j|k|l|m|n|o|p|q|r|s|t|u|v|w|x|y|z|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|E|F|G|H|I|J|K|L|M|N|O|P|Q|R|S|T|U|V|W|X|Y|Z|A|B|C|D|

**Example question**: Plaintext of ciphertext "TYJ"?

- Answer: Using the key above (4-shift), work backwards.

#### Cryptanalysis: Shift (Caesar) Cipher

**Is the Shift Cipher Secure?** ❌ **No** — it is trivially breakable

**Reason**: The key space is extremely small

- Only 26 possible keys (25 meaningful shifts)

**Brute-Force (Exhaustive Search) Attack:**

**Attack strategy:**

1. Intercept the ciphertext
2. Try decrypting with every possible shift
3. Inspect the results
4. The correct plaintext is the one that makes sense in the language

**Example:**

- Ciphertext: `lipps asvph khoor zruog jgnnq yqtnf ifmmp xpsme`
- Trying different keys:
    - n = 4 → "hello world ..." ✅
    - Other values → gibberish ❌

#### Letter Frequency Analysis

**Concept**: Natural languages have non-uniform letter distributions

**In English**:

- Letters E, T, A, O appear far more often than Q, Z, X
- This leakage can be exploited to break substitution ciphers

**English letter frequency distribution** (based on large text samples):

- With sufficient ciphertext length, frequency patterns in the ciphertext approximate these distributions
- This enables cryptanalysis of mono-alphabetic substitution ciphers

#### Vigenère Cipher

**Definition**: A poly-alphabetic shift cipher - an extension of the Caesar cipher

**Key Features:**

- Uses multiple shift values instead of a single fixed shift
- Shift values are determined by a repeating key
- Each key letter specifies a shift based on its alphabet position (a = 0, b = 1, c = 2, …)

**Example:**

- Key: cafe
- Plaintext: tellhimaboutme
- The key repeats: cafecafecafeca

**Security Question:** If the key length is 4 and each key character can be one of 26 letters, what is the size of the key space?

- Answer: 26^4 = 456,976 possible keys

**How It Works:**

- Plaintext letters are shifted by different amounts
- The key is repeated to match the length of the plaintext
- This makes frequency analysis harder than for mono-alphabetic ciphers

#### Attacking the Vigenère Cipher

**Important**: A direct brute-force attack against the Vigenère cipher is theoretically possible but impractical for longer key lengths.

**Key Insight**: Vigenère is not broken directly — it is broken by:

- Exploiting key repetition
- Reducing the problem to multiple simple ciphers

**Step 1: Determine the Key Length**

**Idea**: The key repeats → patterns repeat in the ciphertext

**Method:**

1. Look for repeating sequences (typically 3 or more letters)
2. Measure the distances between repetitions
3. Likely key lengths are factors of these distances

**Step 2: Reduce to Caesar Ciphers**

Once the key length is known:

1. Divide the ciphertext into segments based on the key length
2. Each segment was encrypted using the same shift
3. Each segment can now be treated as a Caesar cipher

**Example:**

- Key length = k
- Ciphertext = C₁, C₂, C₃, ...
- Segment 1: C₁, C₁₊ₖ, C₁₊₂ₖ, ...

**Step 3: Frequency Analysis**

For each segment:

1. Compute letter frequencies
2. Compare with expected English frequencies
3. Guess the shift (e.g., 'E' is most common)
4. Recover each key letter independently

#### Generalizing Shift Ciphers: Substitution Ciphers

**From Caesar to Substitution:**

- **Caesar cipher**: fixed shift for all letters
- **Substitution cipher**: no fixed shift
    - Each plaintext letter is mapped to a unique ciphertext letter
    - The mapping (a permutation of the alphabet) is the key

**Example Mapping (Key):**

- Alphabet: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
- Permutation: ZEBRASCDFGHIJKLMNOPQTUVWXYA
- Mappings: A → Z, B → E, C → B, ...

**Key Space Size:**

- Alphabet size = 26 letters
- Number of possible keys = 26! (all permutations)
- This is an enormous key space compared to Caesar or Vigenère
- 26! ≈ 2^88 ≈ 4 × 10^26

**Security Implications:** The vast number of possible permutations makes the generalized substitution cipher significantly more secure compared to the Caesar cipher. While the Caesar cipher only has 25 possible shifts (excluding the trivial shift of 0), a substitution cipher with permutations has an exponentially larger number of possible keys, making it much more resistant to brute-force attacks.

**But Is It Secure?** ❌ **No** — despite the huge key space

**Reason:**

- Substitution ciphers preserve letter frequencies
- Vulnerable to frequency analysis and pattern matching

**Lesson**: Large key space alone does not guarantee security

#### Double Transposition Cipher

**Definition**: A transposition cipher involves rearranging the letters of the plaintext according to a specific system or key. Unlike substitution ciphers which replace characters, transposition ciphers shuffle the order of characters.

**The Double Transposition Cipher** uses two rounds of transposition to encrypt the message.

**Example:**

- Plaintext: "attackatfour"
- Array size: 4

**Step 1: Arrange in array:**

```
a t t a
c k a t
f o u r
```

**First transposition:** Permute rows from (1, 2, 3) to (3, 2, 1)

```
f o u r
c k a t
a t t a
```

**Second transposition:** Permute columns from (1, 2, 3, 4) to (4, 2, 1, 3)

```
r o f u
t k c a
a t a t
```

Reading the result gives the ciphertext.

**Key Question**: Which principle does transposition use?

- Answer: **Diffusion**

### More on Cryptanalysis

#### Types of Attacks

**1. Ciphertext-only attack**

- Trudy (the adversary) has access to the ciphertext
- Tries to recover the secret key and the plaintext

**2. Known-plaintext attack**

- Trudy knows the plaintext and the ciphertext
- She tries to recover the secret key
- This is not uncommon at all!

**3. Chosen-plaintext attack**

- Trudy can choose a specific plaintext and then obtain the corresponding ciphertext
- By doing this repeatedly with different plaintexts, she attempts to recover the secret key
- This type of attack gives the attacker more control
- Particularly powerful because it allows seeing how the encryption algorithm responds to various inputs

#### Cryptanalysis Techniques

**Language Letter Frequency Tables:**

- Dutch Letter Frequencies available
- Other languages also have documented frequency distributions

**Techniques:**

- **Anagramming**: Rearranging letters of a ciphertext to find potential plaintexts. Particularly useful with simple substitution ciphers, transposition ciphers, or when solving anagrams in general.
- **Dictionary Attacks**: Using a list of likely words or phrases to decrypt messages

#### Sufficient Key-Space Principle (SKSP)

**Definition**: For encryption to be secure, the key space must be large enough to make brute-force attacks impractical.

**Question**: Is SKSP a sufficient or a necessary condition for a secure cryptosystem?

**Answer**: Necessary condition, NOT a sufficient condition!

**Explanation:**

**Necessary Condition:**

- For a cryptosystem to be secure, it must have a sufficiently large key space to prevent brute-force attacks
- If the key space is too small, attackers could feasibly try every possible key to break the encryption
- Therefore, a large key space is necessary to ensure that brute-force attacks are impractical

**Not Sufficient:**

- However, simply having a large key space does not guarantee that a cryptosystem is secure
- Other factors are crucial:
    - The algorithm's resistance to different types of attacks (cryptanalysis, side-channel attacks)
    - The quality of the key generation process
    - The proper implementation of the cryptosystem
- For instance, if the cryptographic algorithm has vulnerabilities or if the keys are not truly random, an attacker might still be able to break the encryption despite a large key space
